STILL NEED TO DO:

Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. For example, 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = should yield 42. An example of the behavior weâ€™re looking for would be this student solution. Your calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. If you enter a number then an operator and another number that calculation should be displayed if your next input is an operator. The result of the calculation should be 
used as the first number in your new calculation.
